## Description
This is a 'IPL Winner Prediction' project, which can predict the winner team of Indian Premier League, based on the trained data set 'deliveries.csv' and 'matches.csv'.
We have tried to train the system based on previous match histories and other factors like venues, weather etc. so that it can be able to forecast a possible winner. For this, different machine learning algorithms have been used.
